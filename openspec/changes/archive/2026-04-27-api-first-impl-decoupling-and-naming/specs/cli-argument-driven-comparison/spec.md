## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: CLI executes library comparison using provided server and database arguments
The CLI SHALL create SQL Server JDBC connections for left and right databases using `-S`, `-U`, `-P`, `-l`, and `-r`.
The CLI SHALL execute comparison through API service contracts using the parsed table list.
The CLI SHALL NOT directly construct or invoke non-configuration classes from `sqlcomparer-impl` for comparison orchestration.
The CLI SHALL emit deterministic comparison report output in the selected output format.
The CLI SHALL write successful output to stdout or the file selected by `-o` according to output destination rules.

#### Scenario: CLI runs comparison for left and right databases
- **WHEN** valid connection, table, output format, and output destination arguments are provided and the databases are reachable
- **THEN** the CLI executes comparison through API service contracts and writes deterministic report output to the selected destination

#### Scenario: CLI reports execution failures
- **WHEN** connection or comparison execution fails
- **THEN** the CLI exits with a non-zero status and writes a clear failure message to stderr
